# `nomox-viewer`

this is an _example_ implementation of the nomox API written with vite and solid.

## features

- quite fast (thanks to solid)
- relatively small bundle size (thanks to vite)
- no tracking or ads!
- quality of life improvements (some of which are paywalled on twitter!)
  - download images and videos without hassle
  - (planned) additional moderation/tweet filtering
  - (planned) bookmark folders

## running

- `git clone https://github.com/nedoxff/nomox`
- `cd untangler`
- `npm install` (configuration is not possible yet)
- use the same commands you would use in any vite project, i.e. `npm run dev` for a development environment and `npm run build` to build a production bundle.
